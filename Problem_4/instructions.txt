Need to find two values:
 - Oxygen Generator Rating (OGR)
 - CO2 Scrubber Rating (CSR)


--- SEARCH THE VALUE USING THE BIT CRITERIA ---
 - From the Input consider only the first bit:
    - If they do not match the bit criteria associated to the value that you are searching discard it.
    - If you have only one number you have found the value.
        - If not repeat with the next bit to the right until one value remains.

--- OGR BIT CRITERIA ---
 - Determine the most common value in the curret bit position.
 - Keep only the numbers who have that bit in their position.
 - If 1 and 0 are equally common discard the 0's.

 --- CSR BIT CRITERIA ---
 - Determine the least common value in the curret bit position.
 - Keep only the numbers who have that bit in their position.
 - If 1 and 0 are equally common discard the 1's.
